Overview of Project

Academic Cache will provide its users with support to manage technical resources for future references. It will facilitate the users to manage their personal resource library. The purpose of this library will not only be to manage the books but user can manage the technical contents available in resources like Books, Magazine, CDs and Web links topic wise.

User will make entries of resources corresponding to a specific Topic or related topics. Users will be able to keep his resources information private or can make it public. Any information stored by users given public access can be accessed publicly otherwise the information will remain private to owner only.

Often it is difficult to get all the information about a particular topic studied few years back. Academic Cache will help to keep such information online and user will be able to get it and share it when required.

It will provide effective search engine that will be useful to get all the information related to a Topic.

The various features of Academic Cache are:

1. The main feature of Academic Cache is the management of resources on centralized server. Users will be provided with the support to upload and download files from the central server.

2. It will provide facility to manage resources according to categorization such as books, media files and links.

3. It will provide the facility to search among the resources uploaded by users.

4. It will facilitate users to keep their resources private (i.e. non-shareable) and public (shareable).Also a user will be able to make request to get access to a resource which is private.

5. It will provide secure environment for resources as a user will be able to access, download and share resources only if he has a user account with Academic Cache.



Current System:
Currently the system is a manual system. In the current system if a user needs to find details of the topic which he studied some months or years back, then he must have that particular resource from where he studied that topic or he must remember exactly from which resource(s) he studied that topic. In case if the user studied a particular topic from a web site then he saves detail of sites in bookmarks, but bookmarks can be used only from the system in which they were saved. In current system a user does not have a central place where he can store his resources or details of resources and access them from anywhere.
